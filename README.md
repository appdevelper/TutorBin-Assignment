Create an App to place an order for a Restaurant:

Display menu and a submit button to place the order.
List all items sorted by category.
User can select an item. Once selected, the user can edit (add or remove) the quantity.

Show 3 popular items and mark the most ordered item 'bestseller' (get most ordered items from previous orders created. For 1st order from the user, there will not be any previous orders and most ordered items, so just hide popular items section).
